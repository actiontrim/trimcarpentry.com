Hello! My name is Action Trim. I am a professional carpenter and this is my trimcarpentry.com project. Follow along as i escrape the matrix!

this is the most current rendition of trimcarpentry.com. it fixed most of the previous bugs. 
it picks up at the beginning of the paypal integration process. 

to do:
fix checkout button hidden on iphone bug
paypall button integration
side bars' pages created
sidebar item pages linked to cart and checkout
nav bar content isnt linked within the policy footer code
finish action trim button
style better
style checkout page
index.html footer and navbar need flex boxes for iphones like policy pages/navbar pages
URGENT! orange close/checkout button on cart needs raised so its visible easily on iphones. its hidden currently unless you scroll upwards on cart sidebar.
